        A passionate developer from India 🇮🇳
        <br />
        I design the visual layer to create a beautiful user experience.
        <br />
        ⚡ I like to code things from scratch, and enjoy bringing ideas to life
        in the browser.
        <br />
        🌱 My Primary purpose:
        <br />
        --> write code that is communicating with others.
        <br />
        --> code must be readable. <br />
        --> more declarative, less Imperative.
        <br />
        I love❤️ to code in JavaScript.
